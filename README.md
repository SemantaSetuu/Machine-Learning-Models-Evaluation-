In this project I have performed different machine leaning models on 3 different datasets to see which model performs better. 6 different models have been taken here. And compared calculation metrics so that I can get an overview of which model performs well. From this I get to know how a modelâ€™s performance can be improved. Such as, if there is any nonlinear relationship between data then which model need to be used.
